Create (implement) a tree in which any node has an integer value and pointers to left and right subtrees (the node may have also some other elements if it helps, i.e. int height)
Add the following elements in such a way that elements smaller than root should be added into the left subtree, elements greater than root should be added into right subtree

    45, 27, 67, 36, 56, 15, 75, 31, 53, 39, 64

Calculate balance factors and check if it is an AVL tree
